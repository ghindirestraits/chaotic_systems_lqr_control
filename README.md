# LQR Control for Chaotic Systems
This repo is intended to hold the scripts I've developed for my final paper as a undergrad student in Control and Automaition Engineering.

In these folders you'll find source code for five different chaotic systems:

- Aizawa system
- Arneodo system
- Lorenz system
- RÃ¶ssler system
- Thomas system

So, clone the repo and have fun!
